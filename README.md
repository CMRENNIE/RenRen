SortFlip 
======

SortFlip is a Pebble watch game written in C.
The object of the game is to sort the 4x4 board from 1-16
You can flip rows or columns 
A correctly sorted board looks like this:
<table>

  <tr>  <td>1</td><td> 2</td><td>  3</td><td>  4</td> </tr>
  <tr><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>12</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>15</td><td>16</td></tr>
</table>
Level One has one column or row 'flipped'

<table>

  <tr>  <td>4</td><td> 3</td><td> 2</td><td> 1</td> </tr>
  <tr><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>12</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>15</td><td>16</td></tr>
</table>

Addiotnal rows/columns are flipped as you press up in levels. 
Level 5 is very hard. I have not completed level 6 
I may have made this too hard. 
I was aiming for a Rubiks cube like game
